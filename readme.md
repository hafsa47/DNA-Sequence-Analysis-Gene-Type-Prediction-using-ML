## 📚 Project Overview

This project explores DNA sequence data and predicts gene types using machine learning:

- **Data Exploration**: Visualize sequence length, nucleotide composition, and gene type distribution.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extract n-gram features from DNA sequences.
- **Modeling**: Train a logistic regression classifier to predict gene types.
- **Evaluation**: Assess model performance with accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC curves, and feature importance.


## Dataset 
DNA sequence prediction is a crucial task in bioinformatics, enabling researchers to analyze genetic patterns, predict mutations, and model gene structures. This dataset can be used to implement three machine learning approaches to predict nucleotide sequences

We use nucleotide sequences of human genes from the NCBI Gene Database. The dataset consists of:

1. Gene symbols, descriptions, and types.
2. Nucleotide sequences represented as A, T, C, G.
3. Train-validation split: 80% training, 20% testing
